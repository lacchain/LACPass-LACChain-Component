# LACPass-LACChain-Component 

## Summary

The LACCPass-LACChain component enables Health Ministries or Health Organizations to manage their onboarding on the LACPass trust network, empowering them to issue and deliver health certificates to patients or individuals. 

This manual describes the steps to run the LACPass-LACChain component, and specifies how to use the endpoints.

### Requirements
- Internet access
- Make sure you have up and running and instance of the LACPass-LACChain component part of `IPS-national-backend` available at https://github.com/RACSEL/IPS-national-backend
- Access to the 'client-helper.sh` executable script available at https://github.com/lacchain/IPS-national-backend/blob/master/lacchain-setup-helper/client-helper.sh
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) software

### Verify Service availability
1. Running the lacpass-lacchain component from `IPS-national-backend` will expose the service at port 3010.
2. Verify the lacpass-lacchain service is running either checking the logs or running a telnet command with the proper URL in a bash shell:

### Configuring the service

Now run the CLI Main Men√∫ (Client helper executable script) that will enable you to setup the decentralized identifier [DID](https://w3c.github.io/did-core) for your organization and set some keys to sign the Health certificates.

1. Make sure you have verified the service availability as described in the previous section [Verify service availability](https://github.com/lacchain/LACPass-LACChain-Component#verify-service-availability)
2. Before running the CLI make sure to execute this in a linux bash terminal:

```
$ chmod +x client-helper.sh
$ bash client-helper.sh
```
3. Now enter the URL of the lacpass-lacchain verified in the previous section [Verify service availability](https://github.com/lacchain/LACPass-LACChain-Component#verify-service-availability) as shown in the following prompt:

![](https://github.com/lacchain/LACPass-LACChain-Component/blob/main/examples/apiURL.png)

4. The CLI (Command Line Interface) Main Menu is presented:

## Onboard health organizations setup process

Please follow these steps for the onboard setup of your Health organization in the LACPass trust network:

1. Create a decentralized identifier [DID](https://w3c.github.io/did-core) typing 'CD' in the CLI Main Menu:

![](https://github.com/lacchain/LACPass-LACChain-Component/blob/main/examples/CLICreateDID.png) 

and a DID will be created and saved in a `did.txt` file: 

![](https://github.com/lacchain/LACPass-LACChain-Component/blob/main/examples/didtxtfile.png)

2. Afterwards, a DID manager must be created, type 'CM' in the CLI Main Menu and enter the number of days in which the manager will be considered valid, for example: 1000 days. Do not enter a number less than 365 days.

and a successful response will be displayed:

4. And, type 'exit' to end the onboard setup process.
 
![](https://github.com/lacchain/LACPass-LACChain-Component/blob/main/examples/exit.png)

After completing the onboard setup process, the following information will be in the `lacchain-setup-helper` directory:

- A `did.txt` file containing the decentralized identifier (DID) of your organization, have it handy in case you need to access the DID.

## Sharing the information for onboarding the LACPass trust network

Now you are ready to share the onboarding information with the committee, please follow these steps:

1. Start the CLI again.
2. Now enter the URL of the lacpass-lacchain service (as you did previously)
3. Type 'GCM' (Get Current Manager) **to fetch the entity and manager details** as shown:

![](https://github.com/lacchain/LACPass-LACChain-Component/blob/main/examples/GCM.png)

Copy the content in a text file and name the file something like `Entity-Manager-Details.txt`.

4. Pack the following infromation in a zip file:

a) `Entity-Manager-Details.txt` file

b) Organization identifying information in a text file:

```
  i. Legal name
 ii. FHIR-URL
iii. Country/State code
``` 

5. Send the zip file via e-mail to epacheco@iadb.org and antoniole@iadb.org

## Sending Health certificates wrapped as Verifiable Credentials

In this section you will learn how to use the endpoint exposed by the lacpass-lacchain component to send health certificates as [verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). If you successfully followed the previous steps, you are ready to send health certificates to your users. 

As explained in [Verify service availability](https://github.com/lacchain/LACPass-LACChain-Component#verify-service-availability) section lacpass-lacchain runs on port 3010 by default. To send DDCCCoreDataSet health certificates you can use the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) tool with the following parameters:

* Method: POST
* http://localhost:3010/api/v1/verifiable-credential/ddcc/send (update the host properly in case you are not accessing via localhost)
* The required payload to send has the following structure:

```javascript
 { 
  "bundle":
          {
            "entry": 
             ["string"]		
          },
   "issuerDid": "string",
   "receiverDid": "string"
 }
```

Where:
* **bundle:** DDCC FHIR Bundle, just copy and paste the full FHIR Bundle
* **IssuerDid:** Issuer DID, this is the decentralized identifier you created in the section Running Setup/Onboard steps in step 6 and that is available in the lacchain-setup-helper/did.txt file
* **receiverDid:** This is the Receiver DID (the patient/individual receiving the certificate) will share with you to receive the issued credential in their wallet. Patients/individuals can easily get their unique decentralized identifier (DID) after setting up their digital wallet available at https://lacpass-openprotest-wallet.lacchain.net/

**NOTE:** A full example with the required payload is available at https://github.com/lacchain/LACPass-client/blob/master/docs/Credential-Sending.md

## Setting up digital wallet patient/individual

### Requirements

- Internet access
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox) desktop or mobile
- Access to the digital wallet setup available at https://lacpass-openprotest-wallet.lacchain.net/

Please follow this steps to setup your digital wallet:





### LACPass Verifier

LACPass Verifier is the last component used to verify DDCC-compliant health certificates. This component is made up of two subcomponents:

1. LACPass-front-verifier: This is a full front-end component that needs to be connected to LACPass-trusted-List to check the validity of health certificates. The repository is available at https://github.com/lacchain/LACPass-front-verifier
2. LACPass-trusted-list: This is the backend API component which cryptographically verifies certificate issuers and decodes data returning it alongside the certificate health validity. Access to this repository is available at https://github.com/lacchain/LACPass-trusted-list

**Note:** A fully runnning instance of LACPass Verifier can be found at https://lacpass.lacchain.net/
